# Examples

## 🐇 Basic Lotka-Volterra example

Below is an example of using `aqua-blue` to predict the predator-prey
[Lotka-Volterra equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotka%E2%80%93Volterra_equations):

$$ \dot x = \alpha x - \beta xy $$
$$ \dot y = -\gamma y + \delta xy$$

with parameters $\alpha = 0.1$, $\beta = 0.02$, $\gamma = 0.3$, and $\delta = 0.01$, and initial conditions
$(x_0, y_0) = (20, 9)$. We train a reservoir computer with a reservoir dimensionality of $1000$ over $0\leq t\leq 10$,
with $1000$ timesteps. Then, we predict the next $1000$ timesteps.

Here, we use `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` to integrate the system of differential equations.

.. include:: ../examples/lotka-volterra.py
```

## 🕓 Using datetime objects

Below is an example of a simple sine-cosine task similar to above, using `datetime.datetime` objects as times.

```py
.. include:: ../examples/sine-cosine.py
```

## 📡 Load and output a JSON string

Below is an example of inputting a `json` string as the training data, and outputting a `json` string for the
prediction. This is particularly useful for interfacing `aqua-blue` with already-existing systems.

```py
.. include:: ../examples/json_example.py
```

## 🏋 Explicit weights

Below is an example of generating explicit matrices for $W_\text{in}$ and $W_\text{res}$. Here, `sparsity=0.99` and
`spectral_radius=1.2` respectively zero-out $99\%$ of $W_\text{res}$'s elements and force $W_\text{res}$ to have a
[spectral radius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_radius) of $1.2$. We also showcase the `>>` operator, which
concatenates instances of `aqua_blue.time_series.TimeSeries`.

```py
.. include:: ../examples/explicit-weights.py
```

## 📈 Explicit activation function

Below is an example of using a different activation function to map from the input state to the reservoir.
Here, we use both hyperbolic tangent (`tanh`) and the [error function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_function)
(`erf`), and compare the results.

```py
.. include:: ../examples/activation-functions.py
```
